### Checking your payment status

You can check your payment status on your [user page](/usersuite). You have to login with your username and password.
When the payment has reached our bank account it will be allocated to your account by an automated software system.

### Intended use

The contributions of all members are administrated by us and will be completely reinvested. The administrators are working completely voluntarily and do not get any money for doing their job.

The network has to be maintained, we need spare parts for the servers and other network hardware so that we can ensure that every service is working. If you are having any further questions, just feel free to come by.
