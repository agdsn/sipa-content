If you want to use multiple devices or just have WiFi, you have to get a Router. The followign table lists a few devices which have successfully worked in our network, although this list may not be complete.

If all you want is a cheap, working solution, we recommend the __TP-LINK WR841__.

###Security advice
We recommend to allways change the default passwords for the WiFi and admin interface. For several vendors there are easy ways to determine the default passwords from the network's name and/or MAC-address.
