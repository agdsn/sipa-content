###Within two AG DSN Dormitories

Please let the support of your current dormitory know of your moving.
At your new location, start a _new membership_ hinting where you moved out from. If you payed for the current semester there is no need of an additional fee.

###Other Dormitories
Please let the support of your current dormitory know that you move out and and [quit your membership](../membership/termination). This only affects you if your old dormitory is part of the AG DSN network, too.

###Short-term relocation
