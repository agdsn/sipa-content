The “Arbeitsgemeinschaft Dresdner Studentennetz”, short AG DSN, is a student organization in Dresden. We are volunteers who manage the connection of the dormitories to the university network – and therefore to the internet.

Additionally, we work at soft- and hardware projects and collaborate with other people and organizations concerning a wide range of topics. Actual information can be found on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ag_dsn/) and [Github](https://github.com/agdsn/).

###Interested?

Awesome technology, interesting systems and just nice people. You found something you like about that? Just join us!

Everybody is welcome. We are happy about everyone helping to maintain and expand our network. Collaborating is easy, even if you do not live in a dormitory: Just contact us at [du-bist-gefragt@agdsn.de](mailto:du-bist-gefragt@agdsn.de).

We are looking forward to hearing from you!
