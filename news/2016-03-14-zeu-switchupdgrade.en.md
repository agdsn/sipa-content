title: Hardware upgrade
author: Friedrich Zahn
date: 2016-03-14
type: warning
outage: [Zeunerstraße]

Today from 7pm onward we will swap out the active components of our network at Zeunerstraße. This will result in network outages, as always we will try to keep these at a minimum.

After restructuring the cabling at Zeunerstraße lately, we now follow up with the active components. Our aim is the introduction of a unified administration for the majority of the students' network, to make sure we can offer you short support response times and a reliable network in the future. If you have any questions, please get in contact!
