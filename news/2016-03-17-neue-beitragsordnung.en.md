Dear Members,

According to the plenary meeting on March 9th, a completely new,
**uniform finance constitution** has been decided on, effective from
April 1st.  Beforehand, height and mode of the contributions differed
depending on the division of the AG DSN.

Please note that the change will have to be confirmed by the
[StuRa](https://www.stura.tu-dresden.de/) to be legally binding, this
is an announcement.

**Summary:** The simplest method for you to pay is to transfer 21€ to the
according finance account at the beginning of each semester.

**Details:**

- The contributions are due at the end of each month.
- If the membership starts after the 14th of a month, the contribution
  for this month is omitted.
- The contribution amount is 3.50€, which is equivalent to 21€ per
  semester.

The main motivation is to make the contributions more uniform and
just.  Members who stay only a few months might have had to pay for a
whole semester if they didn't align with the complicated tolerance
regulations, which is now impossible due to the monthly basis.

Your AG DSN.
