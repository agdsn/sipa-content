According to the plenary meeting on March 9th, a new,
**uniform finance regulation** will take effect from
April 1st 2016. Beforehand, amount and mode of the contributions differed
depending on the local division of the AG DSN.

**Summary:** The simplest method for you to pay is to transfer 21€ to the
according [finance account](/pages/membership/membership_contribution) at the beginning of each semester.

**Details:**

- Contributions are due monthly
- The contributions are due the last day of each month
- If the membership starts after the 14th of a month, the contribution
  for this month is omitted
- The contribution amount is 3.50€, which is equivalent to 21€ per
  semester

The main motivation for this change is to make the contributions more uniform and
fair.  Members who stay only for a few month will only have to pay for the time they are actually
using the network, no registration fee is due anymore.

Furthermore we are working hard to establish the same high-quality (gigabit to each room) network everywhere,
especially at the formerly
cheaper Gerok-, Borsberg- and Zeunerstraße. We have already put substantial effort into these upgrades.

Finally, uniform regulations will help us to save on time spent on administrative tasks, so that we
can provide faster responses on support inquiries and work more on technical improvements.
