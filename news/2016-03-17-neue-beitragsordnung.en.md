Dear Members,

According to the plenary meeting on March 9th, a completely new,
**uniform finance constitution** has been decided on, valid from
April 1st 2016. Beforehand, height and mode of the contributions differed
depending on the division of the AG DSN.

**Summary:** The simplest method for you to pay is to transfer 21€ to the
according finance account at the beginning of each semester.

**Details:**

- Contributions are due monthly
- The contributions are due to the last weekday of each month
- If the membership starts after the 14th of a month, the contribution
  for this month is omitted
- The contribution amount is 3.50€, which is equivalent to 21€ per
  semester

The main motivation is to make the contributions more uniform and
just.  Members who want to be members only a few months might have had to pay for a whole semester if they didn't align with the complicated tolerance
regulations, which is now impossible due to the monthly basis.

You can find the constitution [here](/documents/legal/beitragsordnung.pdf).

Your AG DSN.
