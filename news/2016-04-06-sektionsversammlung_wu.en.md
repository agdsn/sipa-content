On Wednesday, April 20th 2016, the division Wundtstraße will hold an assembly
at the NOC in the “Universa-Haus” on the Räcknitzhöhe.  A new treasurer needs to
be elected and the division's membership fee regulation requires revision due
to being superseded by the general membership fee regulation of the AG DSN.
