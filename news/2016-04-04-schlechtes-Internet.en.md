title: Bad Internet connection
author: Jan Braje
date: 2016-04-04
outage: [Hochschulstraße, Wundtstraße, Zellescher Weg, Borsbergstraße, Gerokstraße, Zeunerstraße]

Right now we experience some problems with the stability and speed of our network.

We try our best to find the errors and are in contact with the ZIH (TUD) for a quick solution.

**Update:** Cause of the problems is a construction site at Barkhausenbau,
our uplink is currently limited to 1Gbps. ZIH hopes to reestablish the usual
10Gbps connection until thursday.
