All accounts of members in Wundtstraße and Zellescher Weg, that are in payment
default for more than 31 days, have been suspended.

Please transfer the overdue semester constribution (incl. late fee) to our
[bank account](/sipa/pages/membership/semester_contribution).
Because it can take a few days until we receive your money, you can
[contact us](/sipa/contact) directly, to be re-enabled immediately.
