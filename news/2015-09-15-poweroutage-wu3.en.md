On Thursday (2015-09-17) the Studentenwerk is going to check the electric installations at Wundtstraße 3 on floor 9 and 11-16, which will cause power outages between 9 and 12am. Our network will also be affected since our switches are located at floor 11 and 16.
Due to the radiolink on the roof of Wu3 the dormitories Borsberg- and Gerokstraße will also be affected.
