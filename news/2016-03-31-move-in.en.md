To speed up the registering of all the new people arriving at Borsbergstraße, Wundtstraße and Zellescher Weg, our office at Wundtstraße 5 will be open on Friday
(2016-04-01) from 10am to 6pm.

But not only new members are welcome, we are always looking for new volunteers. If you would like to see and learn how a network for 3000 users is run, have a look!
