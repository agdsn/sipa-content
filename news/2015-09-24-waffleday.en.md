To speed up the registering of all the new people arriving now, our office at Wundtstra√üe 5 will be open next thursday (2015-10-01) from 9 am to 8 pm.

But not only new members are welcome, we are allways looking for new volunteers. If you would like to see and learn how a network for 3000 users is run, have a look! There will be tours through our tech rooms and waffles.
