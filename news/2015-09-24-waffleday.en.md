To speed up the registering of all the new people arriving at Borsbergstraße, Gerokstraße, Wundtstraße and Zellescher Weg, our offices at Wundtstraße 5 and Borsbergstraße 34 will be open on thursday (2015-10-01) from 9 am to 8 pm.

But not only new members are welcome, we are always looking for new volunteers. If you would like to see and learn how a network for 3000 users is run, have a look! There will be tours through our tech rooms.
